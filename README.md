# Text-based Emotion Classification

## Overview

EmoClassify is a machine learning project aimed at classifying emotions in textual data using advanced deep learning models such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). The project utilizes natural language processing techniques to analyze text and categorize it into different emotional categories such as positive, negative, neutral, happy, sad, angry, etc.

## Features

- Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess text data by removing noise, tokenization, and standardization.
- Feature Extraction: Convert processed text into numerical features using BERT embeddings or LSTM representations.
- Model Selection: Choose from advanced deep learning architectures such as BERT and LSTM for emotion classification.
- Evaluation Metrics: Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters for better performance.
- Deployment: Deploy the trained model to classify emotions in new, unseen text data.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
